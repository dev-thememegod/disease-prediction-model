# disease-prediction-model
This project demonstrates the implementation and comparison of multiple machine learning classification models—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—to predict various diseases based on patient data.

Key Features:
Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Model training, evaluation, and comparison

Detailed performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for each model

Analysis of model strengths and reasons behind varying accuracies

Jupyter Notebook with clean, well-commented code for easy understanding and reproducibility

Dataset:
The dataset contains patient records with labeled disease classes including Arthritis, Asthma, COVID-19, Depression, Diabetes, Hypertension, Malaria, Migraine, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis.
